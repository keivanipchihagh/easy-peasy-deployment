# Easy Peasy Monitoring
Preconfigured Grafana, Prometheus and Exporters docker-compose for faster deployment in production. All you do is to setup the `.env` and the rest is done for you!

**NOTE:** The `.env` is not ignored in this repo and you can easily see what is going on, so does everyone else! Please do add the `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
